## Man Pages & Installation

In this part, I created Linux-style **man pages** for all functions and the client program using `groff` syntax.  
An `install` target was added to the Makefile to copy the executable and man pages into system directories.  

After running `sudo make install`, I was able to run `client` globally and view its documentation with `man mycat`.  

### Git Tag & Release
- Tag: `v0.4.1-final`  
- Release: **Version 0.4.1: Final Build**  
- Assets: Final client executable and documentation  

### Key Learning
This stage showed me how professional software is packaged with documentation and installed system-wide. Man pages make programs user-friendly.
