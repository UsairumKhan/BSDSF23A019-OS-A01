Final Project Submission

All branches were merged into `main`, and the `REPORT.md` file was finalized.  
The repository now contains complete project history, multiple tagged releases, and a professional Git workflow.  

### Final Deliverables
- Repository structure with `src/`, `include/`, `lib/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, and `man/`.  
- Multiple Makefiles for direct, static, and dynamic builds.  
- Utility library (`libmyutils`) with tested string and file functions.  
- Final `client` program, man pages, and installation capability.  

### Key Learning
I learned the full cycle of C software development: modular programming, static vs. dynamic linking, Makefiles, Git branching, and GitHub releases. This assignment taught me professional workflows used in real-world projects.
