# BSDSF23A019-OS-A01


This repository contains my Operating Systems Programming Assignment 01.  
The project demonstrates modular programming in C, use of static and dynamic libraries, Makefiles for build automation, Linux documentation (man pages), and professional Git/GitHub workflows including branching, tagging, and releasing.  

The project builds a **utility library (libmyutils)** with two modules:  
- **String Functions**: Custom implementations of common string operations.  
- **File Functions**: Utilities for file processing (word count, pattern searching).  

A driver program (`client`) tests all library functions. The assignment progresses in stages:  
1. **Multi-file Project**  
2. **Static Library Build**  
3. **Dynamic Library Build**  
4. **Man Pages & Installation**  
5. **Final Release**  

Each stage is developed in its own branch, tagged, and released on GitHub.
